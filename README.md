This is a practice of my HTML tutorials. In this project i will build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time I’ve finished.
But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
